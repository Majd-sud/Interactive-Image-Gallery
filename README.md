# 📸 Interactive Image Gallery – jQuery Project

This is a simple **Interactive Image Gallery** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **jQuery**. The project was created as part of Lab 8 for the CCSW321 – Web Development course at the University of Jeddah.

## 📚 Description

This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic image gallery using jQuery. The goal is to provide a smooth and interactive user experience for navigating between images. Users can click **Previous** and **Next** buttons to cycle through the images. 

The navigation is circular, meaning:
- Clicking **Next** on the last image loops back to the first.
- Clicking **Previous** on the first image loops to the last.

This gallery allows you to explore basic jQuery features, such as:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling (`click`)
- Animation (`fadeIn`)
- Element selection and visibility control

It's an ideal starting point for understanding client-side interactivity using jQuery.
